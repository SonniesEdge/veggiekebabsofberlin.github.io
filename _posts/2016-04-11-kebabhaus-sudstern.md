# Bread
Quality bread. It's got that sweetness that makes you wonder if the guy making it was eating maltesers just before slicing it.

# Falafel
Laziness here - premade falafel flying saucers.

# Halloumi
Not tasted, but looks squeaky.

# Sauce
"Alle so√üen bitte" got us a cheeky amount of garlic sauce. But sharf was well piddly. Come on Berlin kebabmeisters - get us some something closer to napalm than Aldi tomato sauce.

# Salad
Fresh tomatoes. Proper eye-watering onions.
